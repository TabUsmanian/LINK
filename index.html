        <h2>Benefits of Reading Classics–Scientifically Proven!</h2>
        <li> Moral Lessons. Classic literature teaches moral lessons that span across time. Seeing how morality doesn’t really change much over the years reinforces the foundational truths that all humans must live by</li>
        <li> Beneficial for Brain Health – In a study by Michigan State University, researchers were stunned by the areas of the brain that were stimulated simply by reading the classics.</li>
        <li> Increased Attention Span – Blog posts and commercials are short. So are sit coms and video games. Most classics are longer and require some times of lengthy focus in order to stay with the plot, thereby forcing your ability to focus your attention to strengthen.</li>
        <li> Inexpensive Entertainment – Sure, this applies to all books, but reading the classics is a great form of cheap entertainment, which is great for those of us on a budget.</li>
